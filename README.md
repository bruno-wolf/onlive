### :metal: A website for booking and see online live music concerts

## :guitar: onlive has a simple ideia
Inspired by the crowdfunding concept, on onlive each artist can:
1. organize a concert
2. choose a ticket price
3. define the minimum of tickets that needs to be sold for the event to happen.
<br />
Experiences like "meet the band" (a 30 minutes live chat before the event starts) or a virtual backstage tour will be encouraged to create different experiences, enhance the audience and increase the revenue for the artist.

### :microphone: onlive in 2 steps
1. The user access onlive website, select an event experience, and buy a ticket.

2. If the number of tickets sold is higher that the minimun defined by the artist each user recieves the ticket with the access code. At the sarting moment  of the event the user returns to onlive website and enters in the arena, a reserved area where he can see the live streaming and chat with all other participants on the event.

## The idea has started
This was an academic project, developed to be the final project for the ReactJS module of web development course at  [etic_](https://www.etic.pt/, "etic_") and it's just a 'darf' of the concept.
